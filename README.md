# Bike_Sales_Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike purchase patterns using an Excel dataset and visualizes key insights through an interactive Excel dashboard. The analysis provides insights into customer demographics, income levels, commute distance, and purchase behavior.

## Data Sources
Excel Dataset: Contains customer details such as gender, age bracket, marital status, region, education level, income, commute distance, and whether a bike was purchased.
Excel Dashboard: Created using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers for interactivity.

## Steps Involved
### Data Preparation
1. Extract Data: Imported the dataset into Excel.
2. Clean Data: Handled missing values, formatted numeric fields, and standardized categorical values.
3. Transform Data: Created new fields where needed (e.g., income brackets, commute distance categories).
### Dashboard Creation in Excel
#### Filters for Interactive Analysis
Marital Status
Region
Education
#### Avg Income Per Purchase (Bar Chart)
Analyzed income levels of customers based on gender and purchase decisions.
Higher income individuals are more likely to buy a bike.
#### Customer Age Brackets (Line Chart)
Majority of bike purchases come from the middle-age group.
#### Customer Commute vs. Purchase (Line Chart)
People with shorter commutes (0-1 miles) are more likely to buy a bike.

## Key Findings
1. Income Influence: Higher-income individuals are more likely to purchase bikes.
2. Middle-Age Buyers: Most purchases come from the middle-age segment.
3. Commute Distance Impact: Customers with shorter commutes (0-1 miles) show higher bike purchase rates.
4. Regional & Marital Status Trends: Further analysis can be done using slicers to check regional and marital status impact.
